It is using state-of-the-art lithium-ion technology to provide clean and \nefficient electrical energy to the heavy equipment, which would ordinarily be powered by a diesel generator. This \ndocument includes a full overview of the system as well as specifications for each subsystem. \n \n \nThe Enertainer is a 10 ft container that is divided into two sections, called the AC section and the DC section. \nThere are seven available doors around the container that access these sections. Each door is marked with a label \non the outside. The AC section is accessed through the control door, AC door, and PCS door. The DC section is \naccessed through DC door #1, #2, #3 and #4. \n \n \n1.1 \nAC Section \nThe AC section is fitted with electronic controllers that communicate together to optimize the overall",

They are also \nused for detecting and responding to abnormal conditions by producing warnings and faults.
